This is an event management database used by college to conduct various competitions in an event .
<br>Software used:Vs code and Xampp Server.
<br>Languages:PHP,Html,CSS,JavaScript
<br>So I will just explain in brief about the various pages that u will come across in our website
<p>HOME PAGE
• It has 3 headers options home, event and admin login.
• As you drag down you get event database.
• In the event database the participants get option for choosing the event of their choice.
This is a predefined database. When a participant enter their choice of event, the values</p>
will then be partially stored in the database. It will be stored permanently only when
the participant completes the registration process.
• Below that is a small section which gives information about the college.
<br>REGISTRATION PAGE
• Registration page is the page that you will be directed as soon as you press any of the
event of your choice.
• Here you have to fill all your details like – name, phone number, branch , college and
email.
• After you fill, you have to press submit for the registration process to get completed.
• Once the registration is done, your data will be stored in the database.
• After that you will be re-directed to the homepage.
<br>ADMIN-PAGE
• Here all the person who are incharge of the event will be made admin and will be given
with a personal username and password.
• Once they enter the user name and password they will enter into the CRUD page which
basically is a page to perform the CRUD operation (Create Read Update Delete).
<br>CRUD PAGE
• This is the page which shows up once the admin login.
• In this page the admin can alter the participants details like :
2
• Read: For some reason if the admin wants to get the list of participants in a particular
event he can access it using the search bar option.
• Update: If a participant wants to update his existing details like name, phone-number,
email etc , he can request the admin to do the changes.
• Delete: If a admin wants to remove a participant due to some reason he can do this by
removing the participant id from the delete option provided.
• Create: If there is vacant place for a participant to join but the registration portal has
been closed . In such case the admin can make add a participant from the create option
provided .
• All these changes is possible in the crud page.
